# DSA Study

I plan to use this repository to study data structures and algorithms. 
I'm working through the 1990 edition of Robert Sedgewick's *Algorithms in C*.

I'm still trying to decide whether this DSA study should be completed in C or not. 
The purpose of this study is to learn DSA, so the focus should be on the concepts instead of the implementation. 
However, implementation does matter in a practical sense...I may end up using whatever language I want at the time of writing a given algorithm or structure.
